To get working:
  1) Follow these instructions (http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d5/de5/tutorial_py_setup_in_windows.html) to install opencv
  2) Download the Ximea junk, make sure to download with api. (https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/XIMEA_Windows_Software_Package)
  3) Download Tk/tcl development kit for interface (https://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/download.html)
  3) Download the Python module PySerial.
  
I think that's it. Email me if it's not.
